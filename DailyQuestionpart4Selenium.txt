1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
	* Selenium is the free automated testing framework used to validate web application across different browsers and platform.
	* We can use the multiple programming languages like Java,C#,python,etc to create selenium test scripts.
   Selenium software tools:
     1.Selenium integrated development environment(IDE)
     2.Selenium remote control(RC)
     3.WebDriver
     4.Selenium Grid.
2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
	* To communicate between server and client (browser), selenium web driver uses JSON.
	* Each Browser Driver has its own HTTP server.
3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
	id,classname,linktext,partial linktext, name, xpath, attribute.
4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
	Locating with ID is faster than xpath; as with xpath, locating element involved traversing through the DOM
     	IDs are unique.
5.How to select value in dropdown?
	 * Import the package org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select
   	 * Instantiate the drop-down box as an object, Select in Selenium WebElement
    	*  create an object ;
    	*  select d1 =new select();
    	* now use that objects
    	* 3 locators canbe use in dropdown  1.byindex 2.byvisibleindex 3.byvalue.d1.selectbyindex();
6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
	Absolute XPath begins from the root of the beginner
     	but relative XPath begins from the grandparent tag, parent tag, child tag.
7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
	We can verify the checbox by using isSelected() method over the checkbox.
    	isSelected() method returns the boolean values .
8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
	WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code. 
	By default, it downloads the latest version of the browser binary and also the binary for the appropriate platform.setProperty method is used to configure the browser driver path
9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
	//Eldersibling xpath/following-sibling::youngsibling tagname/xpath
    	//youngsibling xpath/following-sibling::Eldersibling tagname/xpath
10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
	To get the attribute value using selenium webdriver, we can use 'element. getAttribute(attributeName)'.
    	If we try to get the attribute value that doesn't exist for the tag, it will return a null value
   	object name.find element.(by.locators).getattribute("value");
	print the value entered in the console.
